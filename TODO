[ ] If we have more bind calls, we have a problem. Probably we have to use a table like this:
	ipv4 0.0.0.0/80 127.0.0.2/8080
	ipv6 ::/80 ::1/8080
	unix /tmp/sock /tmp/sock1
[ ] Test UDP sendto and sendmsg!
[ ] Probably we have to hijack also dup/dup2/etc.
[ ] Bandwidth per total or per socket. Better, per ip/protocol
[ ] Corrupt data
[ ] Add possibility to change destination of packets.
[ ] MTU
[ ] Add posibility to change on-the-fly the parameters by using a AF_UNIX socket

[ ] http://superuser.com/questions/106781/how-do-you-measure-the-bandwidth-used-by-a-given-process-after-it-has-completed
[ ] Bandwidth limitting also for download
[ ] Dump statistics (bytes, syscalls etc.) in a file specified by a env var.
[ ] Need to study how to set only the class for IPv6. Also check Linux kernel
	to see how prio is set for IPv6 class.
[ ] Nice: Force a protocol on a connection! So, uer tries TCP but get UDP!
[ ] Controlling timeout (SO_RCVTIMEO, SO_SNDTIMEO)
[ ] Enforce connect timeout
[ ] Change data on the fly...
[ ] Allow saving stream data in a file.
[ ] sendmmsg/recvmmsg support
[ ] There are stupid applications (skype) that run poll with timeout 0! Fix it!
